├── styles/             # Global and module-based CSS

```

## Customization

- **Global Fonts & Theme:** MUI theme is customized with `font-weight: 500`, `font-size: 16px`, and consistent `line-height`.
- **Date Picker:** Customized using Flatpickr to resemble the browser's native look.
- **Select & Inputs:** Styled with MUI `sx` prop and additional tweaks for placeholder control and focus states.

## Known Issues / Notes

- Ensure your backend (if connected) returns the expected car data shape.
- Flatpickr replaces the native date input for better control and consistent styling.
- Some mobile styling adjustments may still be in progress.
